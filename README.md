# Deep Learning Mathematics
This is my private repo used for completing the deep learning course offered by Kevin Webster and 
Pierrre Richemond. The course is designed for teaching mathematics PhD students how to use tools like tensorflow and pytorch to aid them in their research. 
## Structure
All original course material will be put in the "Course material" folder, the "solutions" folder are my submissions to the problems described in the course.
